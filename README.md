This is a fork of a Yolov5+StrongSORT repository for my CV project. 

### Notable changes

#### track.py

track.py file was changed according to the project. 
Number of detections per frame was changed to two, since there are only two dogs that need to be detected.
After nonmax suppression I added an additional check that classes that were detected are different. If they are the same - I change the bbox with lower class probability to opposite class.
 
### Example

In the runs/track/ you can find an example of algorithm working with pretrained yolov5
